    "\n",
    "At their core, Large Language Models are **inherently stateless**. Their awareness is confined to the information you provide in a single API call. This means an agent without proper context management will react to the current prompt without considering any previous history.\n",

    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "> - *Tool Output*: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning\n",

      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Hello Sagor Das! I can provide you with a general overview of the current situation in Bangladesh based on recent information. However, please keep in mind that I don't have real-time access to breaking news or highly specific, rapidly changing events. My information is based on the data I was trained on, which has a cut-off point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a general overview of some key areas in Bangladesh as of my last update:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Economy:**\n",
      "*   **Growth:** Bangladesh has been experiencing significant economic growth over the past decade, driven by its strong ready-made garment (RMG) sector, remittances from expatriates, and a growing domestic market.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Inflation, particularly in food and energy prices, has been a concern, impacting household budgets. The country also faces challenges in diversifying its export base and attracting foreign investment.\n",
      "*   **Infrastructure:** There has been substantial investment in infrastructure development, including large-scale projects like the Padma Bridge, metro rail in Dhaka, and the Karnaphuli Tunnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Politics:**\n",
      "*   **Government:** The Awami League, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has been in power for a considerable period.\n",
      "*   **Elections:** General elections are a key political event. Discussions and preparations for future elections, including the fairness and inclusivity of the process, are often prominent.\n",
      "*   **Opposition:** The main opposition parties, such as the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), play a role in political discourse, often raising concerns about governance and democratic practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Social Issues:**\n",
      "*   **Development:** The country has made progress in various social indicators, including poverty reduction, education, and healthcare.\n",
      "*   **Population:** Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, which presents ongoing challenges in resource management and service delivery.\n",
      "*   **Climate Change:** As a low-lying delta nation, Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and salinity intrusion. Adaptation and mitigation efforts are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recent Events (General Areas of Focus):**\n",
      "*   **Economic Management:** Discussions often revolve around managing inflation, foreign exchange reserves, and economic stability.\n",
      "*   **Diplomatic Relations:** Bangladesh maintains relationships with various countries and international organizations, engaging in diplomatic initiatives and seeking partnerships.\n",
      "*   **Development Projects:** The progress and impact of ongoing mega-projects are frequently in the news.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To get the most up-to-date and specific information, I recommend consulting reliable news sources such as:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Daily Star**\n",
      "*   **Prothom Alo** (Bangla)\n",
      "*   **Dhaka Tribune**\n",
      "*   **Reuters**\n",
      "*   **Associated Press (AP)**\n",
      "*   **BBC News**\n",
      "\n",
      "These sources will provide you with the latest developments on political, economic, and social matters in Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any specific area you're particularly interested in, Sagor Das? I can try to provide more detail if you narrow down your focus.\n",

      "User > What is your drowback?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  As a large language model, my drawbacks stem from my nature as an AI:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Lack of Real-time Information:** My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which has a specific cut-off date. I cannot access current events, breaking news, or information that has emerged since my last training update. Therefore, I cannot provide you with the *absolute latest* information on any given topic.\n",
      "*   **No Personal Experiences or Emotions:** I don't have consciousness, feelings, beliefs, or personal experiences. I process information and generate responses based on patterns and information in my training data. This means I can't offer subjective opinions, empathy, or genuine understanding in the human sense.\n",
      "*   **Potential for Bias:** My training data is a reflection of the vast amount of text and code on the internet. This data can contain biases, and therefore, my responses may inadvertently reflect those biases. I strive to be neutral, but it's a continuous challenge.\n",
      "*   **Occasional Inaccuracies or Nonsense:** While I aim for accuracy, I can sometimes generate incorrect information or nonsensical statements. This can happen if the training data is flawed, or if I misinterpret a query. I don't \"know\" things in the way humans do; I predict what words should come next.\n",
      "*   **Difficulty with Nuance and Context:** While I'm getting better, I can sometimes struggle with deeply nuanced language, subtle humor, sarcasm, or complex contextual understanding that humans grasp intuitively.\n",
      "*   **Limited Understanding of the Physical World:** I exist only as code and data. I have no physical body, senses, or ability to interact with the real world. My understanding of physical concepts is purely theoretical, derived from text descriptions.\n",
      "*   **No Independent Critical Thinking:** I don't \"think\" or \"reason\" independently. I process information based on algorithms and patterns. I cannot perform true critical analysis or question the information I'm given in the same way a human can.\n",
      "*   **Dependency on Input:** I can only respond to the prompts I receive. I don't initiate conversations or have my own agenda.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned, which is **Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design**. This is indeed one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving areas. Let me elaborate on what it means and why it's so significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is \"De Novo Drug Design\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, drug discovery often involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Screening:** Taking a library of existing chemical compounds and testing them against a specific biological target to see if any bind and have an effect.\n",
      "*   **Rational Design (with human expertise):** Using knowledge of the target's structure and function to design molecules that might fit and interact with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De novo\" means \"from the beginning.\" **De novo drug design** refers to the process of creating entirely new molecular structures that have never existed before, specifically engineered to have desired properties, rather than relying solely on modifying existing compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How Generative AI is Revolutionizing De Novo Drug Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Generative AI models are a type of artificial intelligence that can create new data that is similar to the data they were trained on. In the context of drug discovery, they are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. Here's how they are applied:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Learning Molecular Language:**\n",
      "    *   AI models learn the \"language\" of chemistry. This involves understanding how atoms bond together, the rules of chemical stability, and the relationships between molecular structure and biological activity. They can represent molecules in various ways, such as SMILES strings (a linear notation for chemical structures) or as 3D graphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Generating Novel Structures:**\n",
      "    *   Once trained, these models can generate entirely new molecular structures. Imagine them as incredibly sophisticated \"molecular printers\" that can invent new chemical blueprints.\n",
      "    *   **Types of Generative Models Used:**\n",
      "        *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation (latent space) of molecules and can then sample from this space to generate new, diverse molecules.\n",
      "        *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks – a generator that creates molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish them from real molecules. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating realistic and novel structures.\n",
      "        *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be combined with generative models. The AI is rewarded for generating molecules that meet specific criteria, guiding the generation process towards desired outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Optimizing for Multiple Desired Properties (Conditional Generation):**\n",
      "    *   This is where it gets truly powerful. Generative AI doesn't just create random molecules; it can be guided to create molecules with specific attributes. This is called **conditional generation**.\n",
      "    *   **Examples of Desired Properties:**\n",
      "        *   **Potency:** How strongly the molecule binds to and affects the target.\n",
      "        *   **Selectivity:** How well it binds to the intended target versus off-targets (reducing side effects).\n",
      "        *   **Solubility:** How well it dissolves in water or biological fluids.\n",
      "        *   **Permeability:** How easily it can cross cell membranes.\n",
      "        *   **Metabolic Stability:** How long it lasts in the body before being broken down.\n",
      "        *   **Low Toxicity:** Avoiding structural features known to cause harm.\n",
      "        *   **Synthesizability:** Whether the molecule can actually be made in a laboratory using known chemical reactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a Big Deal?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Accelerated Discovery:** Instead of years of trial-and-error screening, AI can propose thousands or millions of potential drug candidates in a fraction of the time.\n",
      "*   **Access to \"Undruggable\" Space:** Generative AI can explore vast chemical spaces that might be missed by traditional methods, potentially leading to the discovery of drugs for diseases that currently lack effective treatments.\n",
      "*   **Reduced Costs:** By speeding up the early stages of discovery and improving the quality of candidate molecules, AI can significantly reduce the enormous cost of bringing a new drug to market.\n",
      "*   **Tackling Complex Diseases:** For diseases with complex underlying mechanisms, where multiple factors need to be addressed, generative AI can help design multi-target or highly specific drugs.\n",
      "*   **Personalized Medicine:** In the future, generative AI could potentially design bespoke drugs for individual patients based on their unique genetic and molecular profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Scenario:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a pharmaceutical company wants to develop a new drug to treat a specific type of cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Target Identification:** They use AI to identify a key protein involved in cancer cell growth.\n",
      "2.  **Generative Design:** They then feed this target information into a generative AI model, along with desired properties like \"high binding affinity to the target,\" \"low toxicity to healthy cells,\" and \"good oral bioavailability.\"\n",
      "3.  **Molecule Generation:** The AI generates thousands of novel molecular structures that are predicted to meet these criteria.\n",
      "4.  **Filtering and Prioritization:** These generated molecules are then further filtered by other AI models or human chemists, and the most promising ones are selected for synthesis and experimental testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This whole process can compress what once took years into months or even weeks for the initial candidate generation phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that while generative AI is incredibly powerful for *designing* molecules, it doesn't replace the need for rigorous experimental validation, preclinical testing, and human clinical trials. However, it dramatically improves the starting point for all these subsequent stages.\n",
      "\n",

The AI agent explained that while it doesn\\'t have real-time access, it can provide an overview of significant ongoing trends.\\n\\nKey areas of AI impact discussed include:\\n*   **Drug Discovery and Development:** AI accelerates identification of candidates, optimizes design, predicts trial success, and repurposes existing drugs.\\n*   **Diagnostics and Imaging:** AI enhances analysis of X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, mammograms, and pathology slides for early detection of diseases like cancer.\\n*   **Personalized Medicine:** AI analyzes genomic data and predicts patient responses to tailor treatments.\\n*   **Robotics in Surgery:** AI improves precision and planning for robot-assisted surgeries.\\n*   **Administrative Tasks:** AI automates scheduling, billing, and streamlines hospital operations.\\n*   **Mental Health:** AI is being used in therapy platforms and for early detection of mental health issues.\\n\\nRecent trends and challenges mentioned are increased FDA approvals, the need for explainability (XAI), data privacy concerns, evolving regulatory frameworks, bias in AI, integration complexities, and the cost/accessibility of AI solutions. The agent recommended specific news outlets, conferences, and company announcements for the absolute latest information.\\n\\nFollowing this, the user asked for more details on new developments in drug discovery. The AI highlighted that AI is fundamentally transforming drug discovery. The key new developments are:\\n\\n1.  **AI for Target Identification and Validation:** AI is identifying and validating previously \"undruggable\" targets, uncovering novel biological pathways, and enabling personalized target identification.\\n2.  **Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design:** This was the focus of the user\\'s follow-up question. The AI explained that generative models can create entirely new molecular structures from scratch, optimized for multiple properties like potency, selectivity, and synthesizability. This significantly accelerates discovery, allows exploration of new chemical spaces, and reduces costs.\\n3.  **Advanced AI for Molecule Screening and Synthesis Prediction:** AI enables massive virtual screening and is being developed to predict synthesis pathways.\\n4.  **AI in Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:** AI helps predict trial success, optimize design, and improve patient recruitment.\\n5.  **Real-World Data Integration:** AI analyzes real-world data to inform drug discovery, identify unmet needs, and support drug repurposing.\\n\\nThe agent also listed key companies involved in AI drug discovery and reiterated the challenges of data quality, explainability, experimental validation, and regulatory hurdles.\\n\\nIn the subsequent interaction, the user specifically requested more information on the **second development**, which is **Generative AI for De Novo Drug Design**. The AI provided a detailed explanation of this concept:\\n\\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Creating entirely new molecular structures engineered for specific properties, contrasting with traditional screening or modification of existing compounds.\\n*   **How Generative AI Works:** Models learn the \"language\" of chemistry and use techniques like VAEs, GANs, and RL to generate novel molecular structures.\\n*   **Conditional Generation:** AI can be guided to create molecules with specific desired properties such as potency, selectivity, solubility, permeability, metabolic stability, low toxicity, and synthesizability.\\n*   **Significance:** This approach leads to accelerated discovery, access to previously unreachable chemical spaces, reduced costs, the ability to tackle complex diseases, and potential for personalized medicine.\\n*   **Example Scenario:** An illustration was provided showing how AI could be used to design a cancer drug candidate by identifying a target and then generating molecules optimized for specific therapeutic criteria.\\n\\nThe AI emphasized that while generative AI is powerful for design, it doesn\\'t replace experimental validation and clinical trials.\\n\\n**Unresolved Questions/Tasks:**\\n*   The conversation concluded with a detailed explanation of generative AI in de novo drug design.
